# Testing Setup Summary

The Vitest testing framework has been successfully set up for the code-outline CLI project with comprehensive test coverage.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Testing Dependencies

- **Vitest** - Fast unit testing framework for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **@vitest/coverage-v8** - Code coverage reporting with V8 provider
- **mock-fs** - File system mocking utilities for testing
- **@types/mock-fs** - TypeScript definitions for mock-fs

### 2. Configuration Files

- **vitest.config.ts** - Main testing configuration with:
  - Global test environment setup
  - Coverage reporting configuration
  - Path aliases for packages
  - Test file patterns and exclusions
  - Coverage thresholds (70% global, 75% parser, 80% formatter)

### 3. Test Scripts Added

Root package.json:

- `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm test:run` - Run tests once (non-watch)
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run with coverage reporting
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run in watch mode
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run with Vitest UI

Each package also has individual test commands.

### 4. Test Files Created

#### Parser Tests (`packages/parser/src/parser.test.ts`)

- File parsing for JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX
- Complex nested structures (classes, interfaces, namespaces)
- Depth limiting functionality
- Named-only vs all-nodes filtering
- Name extraction from various node types
- Position tracking verification
- Error handling for invalid files

#### Formatter Tests (`packages/formatter/src/formatter.test.ts`)

- JSON output format validation
- YAML output format validation
- ASCII tree output with colors and indentation
- Null outline filtering
- Edge cases (deep nesting, special characters)
- Format validation and error handling

#### CLI Tests (`packages/cli/src/cli.test.ts`)

- Argument parsing (help, version, format, depth, named-only)
- Input validation and error handling
- File pattern matching with glob patterns
- Integration testing with parser and formatter
- Output format verification
- Error scenarios and graceful failures

### 5. Test Fixtures

Created sample files in `test/fixtures/`:

- **sample.js** - Basic JavaScript with functions, classes, exports
- **sample.ts** - TypeScript with interfaces, enums, classes
- **sample.tsx** - React components with hooks and class components
- **complex.ts** - Complex structures with generics, namespaces, inheritance

### 6. Testing Utilities

- **test/setup.ts** - Global test setup and configuration
- **test/utils.ts** - Helper functions for:
  - Creating/cleaning temporary test files
  - Counting and searching nodes in AST trees
  - Sample code templates
  - Mock NodeInfo creation

### 7. Coverage Configuration

- **Providers**: V8 coverage provider for accurate reporting
- **Reports**: Text, JSON, HTML, and LCOV formats
- **Thresholds**:
  - Global: 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
  - Parser: 75%
  - Formatter: 80%
- **Exclusions**: Test files, config files, build artifacts

## Test Results

âœ… **60 tests passing** across 3 test suites

- Parser: 15 tests
- Formatter: 20 tests
- CLI: 25 tests

All major functionality is tested including:

- Parsing different file types (JS/TS/TSX)
- Output formatting in multiple formats
- CLI argument handling and validation
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Integration between packages

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run specific package tests
cd packages/parser && pnpm test
cd packages/formatter && pnpm test
cd packages/cli && pnpm test

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

# Interactive UI
pnpm test:ui
```

## IDE Integration

The setup works with:

- VS Code Jest/Vitest extensions
- WebStorm/IntelliJ test runners
- Any editor with LSP support

## Next Steps

The testing framework is ready for:

1. Adding new test cases as features are developed
2. CI/CD integration with coverage reporting
3. Performance testing and benchmarking
4. Integration with code quality tools

The test suite provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions as the project evolves.
